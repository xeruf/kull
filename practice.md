# Kull in Practice

## Merging

Rule of thumb: When a branch has more commits than changed files, it should probably be squashed.
If both numbers are in the double-digits, the merge should be rethought or is already known as a special case (see long-running branches below).

## GitHub

## Branch types
- mission/focus/task branches
- grouping branches
- development/long-running/parallel branches -> chore(merge)

## Scopes
When using subscopes, ensure that the commit only changes a single file and its test.
